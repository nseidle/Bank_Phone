Bank Phone

The WOW Kid's museum wanted a rotary phone that automatically played a random track when a kid picked up the handset. If they dialed a number it would play the track associated with that number.

10 kid-friendly audio tracks (plus a 'ring ring' track) are loaded onto the microSD card. Power is provided from a 5V wall wart. The phone is screwed to a desk. I may have to glue the handset cable to the phone if it becomes an issue.

The audio tracks must be converted to mono for this project. Use http://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-wav to convert to mono.
